Writing single-level Ruby-like DSLs is really easy. Ruby practically builds them
for you with a little meta-programming. [Docile](https://github.com/ms-ati/docile)
makes it ridiculously easy and there are nearly a dozen other modules to do so.

Unfortunately, writing multi-level DSLs becomes repetitive and overly complex.
Which is dumb. Multi-level DSLs are where the sweetness lives. We write DSLs in
order to make things simpler for ourselves, particularly when we want to have
less-experienced individuals able to make changes because they have the business
or domain knowledge. Limiting everything to single-level DSLs makes no sense.

`DSL::Maker` provides a quasi-DSL-like structure that allows you to easily build
multi-level DSLs and handle the output.

## Usage

### Single-level DSLs

In its documentation, [Docile](https://github.com/ms-ati/docile) has a DSL that
builds pizza. An example would look like:

```ruby
@sauce_level = :extra

pizza do
  cheese
  pepperoni
  sauce @sauce_level
end
#=> #<Pizza:0x00001009dc398 @cheese=true, @pepperoni=true, @bacon=false, @sauce=:extra>
```

The PizzaBuilder code (via Docile) looks like:

```ruby
Pizza = Struct.new(:cheese, :pepperoni, :bacon, :sauce)

class PizzaBuilder
  def cheese(v=true); @cheese = v; self; end
  def pepperoni(v=true); @pepperoni = v; self; end
  def bacon(v=true); @bacon = v; self; end
  def sauce(v=nil); @sauce = v; self; end
  def build
    Pizza.new(!!@cheese, !!@pepperoni, !!@bacon, @sauce)
  end
end
```

But, this doesn't actually implement the DSL. That is left for another snippet:

``` ruby
def pizza(&block)
  Docile.dsl_eval(PizzaBuilder.new, &block).build
end
```

And it's not quite clear where to actually put this code so that you can ship this
DSL like Chef or Sinatra.

You would implement the same DSL using DSL::Maker as so:

```ruby
class PizzaBuilder < DSL::Maker
  add_entrypoint(:pizza, {
    :cheese => Boolean,
    :pepperoni => Boolean,
    :bacon => Boolean,
    :sauce => String,
  }) do
    Pizza.new(cheese, pepperoni, bacon, sauce)
  end
end

pizza = PizzaBuilder.parse_dsl("
  pizza {
    cheese yes
    pepperoni Yes
    bacon On
    sauce 'extra'
  }
")
```

Now, you accept the strings (possibly from `IO.read()`) and magically get the
result of your DSL.

(The PizzaBuilder is used in the test suite in `spec/single_level_spec.rb`.)

### Multi-level DSLs

So far, this isn't that impressive - slightly better type coercion and a method
for handling the parsing of a string isn't much to crow about.

```ruby
Person = Struct.new(:name, :mother, :father)

class FamilyTree < DSL::Maker
  add_entrypoint(:person, {
    :name => String,
    :mother => generate_dsl({
      :name => String,
    }) do
      Person.new(name, nil, nil)
    end,
    :father => generate_dsl({
      :name => String,
    }) do
      Person.new(name, nil, nil)
    end,
  }) do
    Person.new(name, mother, father)
  end
end

john_smith = FamilyTree.parse_dsl("
  person {
    name 'John Smith'
    mother {
      name 'Mary Smith'
    }
    father {
      name 'Tom Smith'
    }
  }
")
```

Pretty easy. We can even refactor that a bit and end up with:

```ruby
class FamilyTree < DSL::Maker
  parent = generate_dsl({
    :name => String,
  }) do
    Person.new(name)
  end

  add_entrypoint(:person, {
    :name => String,
    :mother => parent,
    :father => parent,
  }) do
    Person.new(name, mother, father)
  end
end
```

There's no limit to the number of levels you can go define.

### Handling Arguments

We can improve the family tree DSL a bit by handling arguments. An example works
best to explain.

```ruby
Person = Struct.new(:name, :age, :mother, :father)
class FamilyTreeDSL < DSL::Maker
  parent = generate_dsl({
    :name => String,
    :age  => String,
  }) do |*args|
    default(:name, args)
    Person.new(name, age)
  end

  add_entrypoint(:person, {
    :name => String,
    :age  => String,
    :mother => parent,
    :father => parent,
  }) do |*args|
    default('name', args, 0)
    Person.new(name, age, mother, father)
  end
end

john_smith = FamilyTreeDSL.parse_dsl("
  person 'John Smith' do
    age 20
    mother 'Mary Smith' do
      age 50
    end
    father {
      name 'Tom Smith'
      age 49
    }
  end
")
```

The result is exactly the same as before.

### Recursive DSLs

We're making an artificial distinction between `person` and `parent` in the
`FamilyTreeDSL` example above. Really, we want to say "A person can have a mother
and a father and those are also persons." So, let's say that.

```ruby
Person = Struct.new(:name, :age, :mother, :father)

class FamilyTreeDSL < DSL::Maker
  person_dsl = add_entrypoint(:person, {
    :name => String,
    :age  => String,
  }) do |*args|
    default(:name, args)
    Person.new(name, age mother, father)
  end

  build_dsl_element(person_dsl, :mother, person_dsl)
  build_dsl_element(person_dsl, :father, person_dsl)
end
```

Now, we can handle an arbitrarily-deep family tree.

### Handling multiple items

Chef's recipe files have many entries of different types in them. It doesn't do
you any good if you can't do the same thing.

```ruby
Car = Struct.new(:make, :model)
Truck = Struct.new(:make, :model)

class VehicleDSL < DSL::Maker
  add_entrypoint(:car, {
    :make => String,
    :model => String,
  }) {
    Car.new(make, model)
  }

  add_entrypoint(:truck, {
    :make => String,
    :model => String,
  }) {
    Truck.new(make, model)
  }
end

vehicles = VehicleDSL.parse_dsl("
  car {
    make 'Honda'
    model 'Civic'
  }

  truck {
    make 'Ford'
    model 'F150'
  }
")
```

`vehicles` is an `Array` with a `Car` and a `Truck` in it, in that order. If your
DSL snippet has only one item, you get back that item. If it has multiple items,
you get back an `Array` with everything in the right order.

## API

### Class Methods

DSL::Maker provides seven class methods - five for constructing your DSL and two
for parsing your DSL.

* `add_entrypoint(Symbol, Hash={}, Block)`

This is used in defining your DSL class to create an entrypoint - the highest
level of your DSL. `add_entrypoint()` will create the right class methods for
Docile to use when `parse_dsl()` is called. It will also invoke `generate_dsl()`
with the Hash you give it to create the parsing.

* `entrypoint(Symbol)`

This returns the DSL defined by a previous call to `add_entrypoint()`.

This is primarily useful if you want to take a DSL class and use it within another
DSL class.

* `generate_dsl(Hash={}, Block)`

This is used in defining your DSL to describe the innards - the guts that actually
have meaning. Once this level has been completed, the Block will be called and the
return value provided back to the name.

* `build_dsl_element(Class, String, Type)`

This is normally called by `generate_dsl()` to actually construct the DSL element.
It is provided for you so that you can create recursive DSL definitions. Look at
the tests in `spec/multi_level_spec.rb` for an example of this.

* `add_helper(Symbol, Block)`

This is used to create helper methods (similar to `default`, described below) that
are used within the DSL.

This creates global helpers that are available at every level of your DSLs.

* `parse_dsl(String)` / `execute_dsl(&block)`

You call this on your DSL class when you're ready to invoke your DSL. It will
return whatever the block provided to `add_entrypoint()` returns.

In the case of multiple DSL entrypoints (for example, a normal Chef recipe),
these methods will return an array with all the return values in the order they
were encountered.

### Coercions

There are three defined coercions for use within `generate_dsl()`:

  * String - This takes any string.
  * Boolean - This takes whatever you give it and returns the truthiness of it.
  * `generate_dsl()` - This descends into another level of DSL.

You will be able to add your own coercions in a forthcoming version of DSL::Maker.

### Helpers

There is one pre-defined helper.

  * `default(String, Array, Integer=0)`

This takes a method name and the args provided to the block. It then ensures that
the method defaults to the value in the args at the optional third argument.

You can add additional helpers using `add_helper()` described above.

## Installation

``` bash
